What I would do is this:

every time I change the elements in the table, I run the sortArray algorithm

in the sort array, I take the first title element in the table and the row index and search 
for it in the array of objects. when I find it, I take the first object in the array and store it in a
temp array. I then push the object that matches the table to the first index, and push the temp object to
the object index I found the table index. I then repeat this for each row in the table, finding the
matching object, placing the nth idex object in a temp, pushing the matching object to that place, and
pushing that object to the place we found the matching object. 

for(i=1;i<table.row.lenth;i++){
    min_index=i
    for(j=0;j<bookLib.length;j++){
        if(bookLib[j].title==table[i].title){
            temp=bookLib[min_index-1]
            bookLib[min_index-1]=bookLib[j]
            booklib[j]=temp
        }
    }
}
